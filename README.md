===========================================

This repo contains my final project submission for the Coursera course Practical Machine Learning course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.  The following files are contained:

1. Practical_Machine_Learning_Project_Ackerman.Rmd is an R Markdown file that generates the HTML document (takes about 24 minutes to Knit on my computer FYI).
2. Practical_Machine_Learning_Project_Ackerman.html is an html file that describes my analysis.
